# Mneme

Mneme helps you write tests about the way things are so that you can remember how they were.

Inspired by [Jane Street's expect-test](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_expect), which you can [read about here](https://blog.janestreet.com/the-joy-of-expect-tests/).

## Installation

**MNEME IS NOT READY FOR GENERAL USE!**
If you're finding it published on Hex, it's only so that I can be my own guinea pig and use it while working on other libraries.

If available in Hex, the package can be installed by adding `mneme` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mneme, ">= 0.0.0"}
  ]
end
```
