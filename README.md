# Mneme

Mneme helps you write tests about the way things are so that you can remember how they were.

Inspired by [Jane Street's expect-test](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_expect), which you can [read about here](https://blog.janestreet.com/the-joy-of-expect-tests/).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `mneme` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mneme, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/mneme>.
